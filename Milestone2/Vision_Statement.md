# Project: Map App 

## Vision Statement

For the general public who need to access information about local places of necessity, the Map App (name pending) is a web application that will provide a point of access to various events in the user's local area and to other places with items of necessity. The website will manage the location of these places and events, keep track and display user information and interests, and allow organizations to add information about their business or events they are holding. This website will help provide a way to view and keep track of information about places with items of necessities such as shelters, thrift stores, and food banks which could help the general public in learning about businesses near them, allow people to gain access to necessities, and help organizations expand and get word out. Unlike various applications and websites that display information about all kinds of events such as Facebook or Ticketmaster, our website will focus on giving people more access to places of need, show events with free or discounted items of necessity, and work to improve users' lives by solving problems related to common struggles such as food insecurity or homelessness.
